Admire extra is a elementor as well as Gutenberg template library where you can choose from available designs and use them with any WordPress theme from the repository or elsewhere.

== Description ==

Admire extra is a Elementor as well as Gutenberg template library where you can choose from available designs and use them with any WordPress theme from the repository or elsewhere. These templates are fully editable using Elementor or Gutenberg block editor. They are full fledged wesbites where you get all pages including homepage and inner pages. All of the templates are being imported from our test server at Admire Themes. You can create a wide range of business websites like hotels, lodging, spa, salon, construction, personal, blog, fitness, medical, health, charity, pet, maintenance services etc.

All of the demos are being downloaded from our test server at Admire Themes. 

Check out our **[free WordPress themes](https://www.sktthemes.org/product-category/free-wordpress-themes/)** as well in case you want more options for free templates.

== How it Works ==

Basically this plugin is a service where you can preview the design of Elementor templates available. Whichever design you like you can just preview it and click on import demo. It will import all the pages of the demo as shown in the preview. 

Preview images are loaded from our server admiretheme.com Even the preview demo that you see are loaded from demo folder of admiretheme.com 

Once you click on import you can tweak and adjust and set up the website as per your choice using Elementor.

Once the import is completed the contents like images, text etc are loaded into your own website and aren't dependent on our server anymore.

This plugin is dependent on the data import from service website: https://admiretheme.com and its privacy and data usage policy can be found here: https://admiretheme.com/privacy-policy.html
